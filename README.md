# üß† Edge Detection in Real-World Applications (OpenCV + Python)

This repository demonstrates **five real-world examples** of edge detection using **OpenCV** in **Python** ‚Äî each visualizing all three major edge detection techniques:

- **Sobel Operator** (Gradient-based edge detection)
- **Laplacian Operator** (Second-order derivative)
- **Canny Edge Detector** (Advanced multi-stage detection)

The project is designed for **Google Colab**, with built-in image upload support.

## üì∏ Overview

Edge detection is a core concept in computer vision. It helps identify object boundaries, patterns, and shapes in an image.  
This repository shows practical examples across different real-world domains.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Techniques Used

| Technique | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Sobel** | Detects intensity gradients in horizontal and vertical directions. |
| **Laplacian** | Uses second derivatives to find edges, sensitive to noise. |
| **Canny** | Multi-stage process with noise reduction, gradient detection, and thresholding. |
